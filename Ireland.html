                    <img src="images/Kilmainham.png" class="image">
                             <p> Kilmainham Gaol is one of the most famous prisons in the world and especially the most 
                              famous in Ireland. The museum opened in 1796 and held all kinds of prisoners. 
                              It was especially notorious for holding and executing some of the most prominent leaders of
                               the Easter Rising. The prison closed down in 1924 but was turned into a national museum in 1960.
                               This museum has a pretty decent tour as far as the time slot goes and worth seeing as there is so much
                               history held behind the walls and bars of this prison. The tours for this prison are pretty cheap as well
                               and gives you several things to look at not just the Kilmainham Gaol. They often include 
                               a hop on and off bus tour around the Dublin.

                                  The castle was first believed to have been built with wood as just a tiny house, and then was replaced with stone

                                  the ownership of the castle changed several times. During the 15th century a mansion was built near the castle 
                                  which is known as the Blarney House, which was burnt down and rebuilt into another mansion in 1874.
                                  Along with these tourist attractions, there is also beautiful and vast gardens that surround all of the castle and house.

                                  <p>Although when you think of Ireland you may think of their many pubs and famous beers, there is some great 
                                    foods that Ireland is known for as well. With there always being a chilly breeze and countless rainy days,
                                 seafood chowder is just the thing someone needs to keep themselves warm in such a cold environment. These creamy soups 
                                are typically filled with vegetables along with oysters, mussels, and salmon. Another dish, which many people might not think would be their go to 
                              thing to try is Irish Soda Bread, butter, and cheese. Their somewhat sweet bread, along with their signature cheese, Gubbeen, makes it a perfect 
                            combination, especially with some wine. One more must try food in Ireland is a delicious dish called Boxty. Boxty is a potato cake basically, which then 
                          is fried on a griddle. There are also versions where it's mashed potatoes that are deep fried. So basically it's hashbrowns but ten times better.</p>
